# See the grep man page for more information.

# Set removable devices location. The default is to ignore /dev/sda*, which is
# usually the primary system drive. Devices such as SD card readers show up as
# /dev/mmcblk* and are also matched. This string is matched using grep like so:
# udisks --enumerate-device-files | grep -ow ${removable_devices} | sort

### This example also includes LUKS encrypted partitions.

### be shown whether or not there is a floppy disk inserted.
### removable_devices="-E /dev/sd[b-z][0-9]+|/dev/fd[0-9]+"

# Set whether to show internal devices. This can be "0" or "1". If you have
# system drives that are always found at the same location (e.g. /dev/sda),
# it is better and faster to hide them using the "removable_devices" option.

# Set devices to blacklist. Any device whose "udisks --show-info" output
# contains a string listed here will be hidden. The strings are matched
# using "grep -E".

###
### This example will match any device with "Photosmart" in any field.
### blacklist+=( 'Photosmart' )
###
### This example matches only the model field, to reduce false positives.
### blacklist+=( 'model: * Photosmart C4400' )
###
### This example matches several different devices. Note that the array can be
### split over multiple lines for convenience.
