bashmount 3.0.0alpha1 (2014-03-23)
  Many thanks to Lukas B. (aka https://github.com/vitamins) for porting
  bashmount to use lsblk where appropriate and a variety of other changes:

  - Information retrieval is now based on `lsblk` instead of `udisksctl`,
    which allows us to get rid of a lot of horrible parsing
  - Devices are sorted by internal media, removable media and optical media
  - Only partitions are listed, no disks
  - Opened luks containers are also listed by default

  Configuration file:
  - Add "mount_command" and "unmount_command" which can be configured by the
    user
  - "optical_devices" and "removable_devices" are no longer present
  - "show_internal" is set to '1' by default
  - "show_removable_device_filename" and "show_optical_device_filename" have
    been replaced by a single variable named "show_device_path"
  - "fancy_sort" is no longer present
